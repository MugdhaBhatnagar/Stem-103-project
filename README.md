Project Title: Riddler's Riddles

The code has 3 files. Riddles contains 3 lists of 6 riddles. They are labeled "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard". There are 3 lists with the respective answers for each riddle. 

In riddler, the functions allow the player has to pick a difficulty for the riddle, then the computer randomly picks a riddle from the list and prints it out. The player has 3 chances to guess the answer, which is tracked by using a for loop. Once the riddle has been answered correctly, it asks the player to play again. If it was wrong after 3 guesses, it tells them the correct answer and asks to play again. If the player chooses to continue playing, the game repeats itself until they say no. IF they say no, the game says 'Goodbye' and exits.
