Project Title: Riddler's Riddles

Objective: The code has 3 lists of 10 riddles. They are labeled "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard". There are 3 lists with the respective answers for each riddle. The player has to pick a difficulty for the riddle, then the computer randomly picks a riddle from the list and prints it out. The player has 3 chances to guess the answer. Once the riddle has been answered correctly, it is deleted from the list. If the player gets it wrong after 3 guesses, the game ends and the player has to start again.
Key Features: Outline how you plan to use:
Variables
Lists that store the riddle and answers: Easy, Medium, Hard; easy_Answers, medium_Answers, hard_Answers,
Var that checks the player's answer: guess
If/Else statements
If the answer is true, the player can select another riddle, if the answer is false after the third try, the program exits
Functions
I plan on using functions to modularize the code
Loops
Loop to check the answer 3 times, ends when the answer is true
“One New Thing”: I plan on using random to randomly generate riddles
Plan: Week 1
make the pseudocode
Find and store the riddles and their answers
make the loops to keep checking the user's answer
Week 2
Write the if-else statement
debug the code and make it run properly
