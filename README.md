Project Title: Riddler's Riddles

Objective: The code has 3 lists of 10 riddles. They are labeled "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard". There are 3 lists with the respective answers for each riddle. The player has to pick a difficulty for the riddle, then the computer randomly picks a riddle from the list and prints it out. The player has 3 chances to guess the answer. Once the riddle has been answered correctly, it is deleted from the list. If the player gets it wrong after 3 guesses, the game ends and the player has to start again.
